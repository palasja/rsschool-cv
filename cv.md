### ABOUT ME
I am 31 year old. I am working as engineer and I am maintaining PC, servers and peripherals. 

I started learn programming from HTML about 8 years ago and since I learned php, js, css, java, SQL but I used it only for simple learning projects.

I can't use C# or java on my work so I learned bath for automatize some process. In last year I accepted offer for work on real project as front-end developer and after a month I had courses C#.
